# Birds of Paradise
Creates bird songs from Tweets about birds!

## ABOUT
This web application makes use of Twitter's streaming API to grab a live feed of Tweets that contain the word 'bird'. From there, the tweet is displayed on the page and plays a random bird call.

Listen to a rather pretty soundscape of birds and a gentle river generated by bird Tweets!
